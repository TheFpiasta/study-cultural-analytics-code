You will be given a list of words to cluster into groups based on their semantic relationships or common themes. Your task is to analyze these words and organize them into meaningful clusters.

Here is the list of words:
<word_list>
{{WORD_LIST}}
</word_list>

To cluster these words, follow these steps:
1. Carefully read through all the words in the list.
2. Identify common themes, categories, or relationships among the words.
3. Group words that share similar meanings, belong to the same category, or are closely related in some way.
4. Create appropriate names for each group that accurately represent the words within it.
5. Ensure that each word is placed in the most suitable group.

Your output should be a Python array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a cluster. The dictionary key should be the group name, and the value should be a list of words belonging to that group. The format should look like this:

[{"group_name1": ["word1", "word2", "word3"]}, {"group_name2": ["word4", "word5", "word6"]}, ...]

Here's a simple example to illustrate the expected output format:

Input: apple, banana, carrot, dog, cat, parrot, run, jump, skip

Output:
[
  {"Fruits": ["apple", "banana"]},
  {"Vegetables": ["carrot"]},
  {"Animals": ["dog", "cat", "parrot"]},
  {"Actions": ["run", "jump", "skip"]}
]

Now, please cluster the provided list of words and present your answer in the specified Python array format. Make sure to use appropriate group names and include all the words from the original list.

Return only the Output array.
